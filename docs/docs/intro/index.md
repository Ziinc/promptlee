## Getting Started

### !. Navigate to the app

Navigate to https://app.promptpro.tznc.net , which is the URL where the official webapp is hosted.

You will need to have an account with the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com), which is the developer platform for interacting with OpenAI's APIs. You will need a credit card to sign up for the account.

### 2. Store your API key in the app

Generate a new API key under the [OpenAI Platform API Keys section](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). Click on "Create new secret key".
