# Security and Trust

PromptPro is a fully open-sourced project and is Apache licensed. Anyone can audit the source code to ensure that API keys are not exposed to any third party.

## Bring Your Own API Keys

To allow direct interaction with the OpenAI API, there is no middleman service between the browser and the API. All data fetched is returned directly from the API.

API keys are stored locally within the browser, and can be inspected by opening developer tools (F12) and viewing the local browser storage.

## About the Project
